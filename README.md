## How to render locally

See https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/


The short version:

(Make sure you have ruby and gem installed, or this won't work)

Setup; skip after you have done this once:
```
gem install bundler

bundle install
```

To serve:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
